                        I've been working at the Wellington City Council as an Junior Analyst Programmer since November 2020. The job involves maintaining, testing and adding
                        functionality to integrations using C#, AWS, and SQL Server primarily.

                        When I'm not coding, I like to spend time with friends, swim, run, read, and make art. I'd like to be a lot of things when I'm older - an astronaut, 
                        an artist, a senior software developer. Right now, I'm still learning a lot about what I like and how to do what I like better.
