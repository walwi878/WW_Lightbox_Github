                  Here's my capstone project that I did in Hong Kong, because if it's not going to be published by a science journal it might as well be published here.
                  The project uses data mining to find novel transcription factors (AKA proteins that turn genes on or off) in the animal with the world's most studied nervous system; <i>C. elegans</i>. 
                  This project helps by providing a better indication of which transcription factors are most expressed in each neuron of <i>C. elegans</i> and reduces the arduous manual efforts scientists of experimentally screening for hundreds of transcription factors in the lab.
